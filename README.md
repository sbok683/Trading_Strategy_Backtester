Project Overview — Trading Strategy Backtester

This project is a Python-based backtesting framework for evaluating simple algorithmic trading strategies on historical stock or ETF price data. It allows you to simulate trades, track portfolio performance, and calculate key metrics like Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, and Monte Carlo projections.

Core idea:

Load historical price data.

Apply a trading strategy (e.g., moving average crossover).

Simulate buying/selling over time.

Measure profitability, risk, and robustness.
